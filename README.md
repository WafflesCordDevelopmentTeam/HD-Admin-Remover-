A Script That Removes The HD Admin Plugin From A Game That Has It's Plugin A Very Simple Script To Use That Does A Simple Thing 

Discord: kz_k1 (Hoshimi)

Thanks For Using The Script And Also Sorry If Both Of The Loadstring's Don't Work

--- HOW TO CLARIFY THAT IT WORKS ---

To clarify it works when executed with the loadstring or the rewrite or the rewrite loadstring (u get the point)
Please Check Dex And Type "HD" Or "Admin" Or "HD Admin" For Anything To See If it's Gone or not From the game entirely! 
This script is just for removing HD Admin FROM Games Who Has It in THEIR Game. So U can Test The Script In You're Game If u have HD Admin in it or any other game (I'm not sure if it works for other games who has HD Admin but u can try)

Credits are above I made this myself.
